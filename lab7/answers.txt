2. dot function:

The C implementation for the dot function was faster than the assembly implementation. With the ratios being 0.46 ns/elt and 0.63 ns/elt for C and assembly implementation respectively.

dot_struct function:

The C implementation for the dot_struct function was faster than the assembly implementation. With the ratios being 0.70 ns/elt and 0.71 ns/elt for C and assembly implementation respectively.

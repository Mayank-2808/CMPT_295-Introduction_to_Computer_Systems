1. do_something initializes %rcx and %rbx, register for counting and register storing result which is call preserved respectfully, rather than returning a value, this in place is used by the loop_top function. The calculations are executed by the loop_top function and returns the result when %rdi is greater than or equal to 60.

2. Preserved registers ('%r12', '%r13', '%r14') were used in the calculate function to hold the values of 'x', 'a', and the intermediate results ('b'Â and 'c'), as these values must be maintained during several functions calls to 'f'. Since we do not need these values after each function call, non-preserved registers (such as '%r10') were utilized for temporary computations ('d'). This decision maintains compliance with the calling convention while optimizing register consumption.
